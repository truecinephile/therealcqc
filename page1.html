<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face">Pleasure to meet you, dear stranger. This is our little, precious club of <i>cinephiles</i> called <i>CQC</i>, <i>Club of Qualified</i><br> 
<i>Cinephiles</i>. Not <i>Close-Quarters Combat</i>, if you are here for that you may leave.</p>
<p align="center">Who is a <i>cinephile</i>? It is a person who enjoys and is able to analyze every filn that they watch. It is not <br>
hard to be one of us, just one basic recommendation: </font> <br><br>
<font color="red" size="5">!!Try not to rank films by scale of numbers!!</font><br><br>
<font size="4" face="Baskerville Old Face" color="black"> 'Cause every work of art is unique in their own way. Just being able to determine whether you liked <br>
what you've watched or not, in what aspects it was good ----> is really better than comparing it to <br>
completely different works. </p>
<p align="center"> If you do not agree, as we said previously you may leave. Though it would've been better if you tried <br>
to show understanding</p>
